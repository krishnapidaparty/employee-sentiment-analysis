### Security Considerations

#### For Production Use:
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting to API endpoints
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Add CORS configuration if needed
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs

#### Slack App Security:
- [ ] Use workspace-specific tokens
- [ ] Implement token validation
- [ ] Add user permission checks
- [ ] Consider OAuth flow for better security

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Enable Next.js caching

- [ ] Consider CDN for static assets

### Monitoring

- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)

- [ ] Track user interactions
- [ ] Set up alerts for API failures
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs

### Backup & Recovery

- [ ] Regular database backups (if adding database)
